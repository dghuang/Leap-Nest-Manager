# Leap-Nest-Manager
A project I created at a hackathon over a weekend.

The idea of this is to create a user interface where you can visualize exactly how hot/cold different rooms in the house and change the temperatures with the Leap Motion controller. You can start the project by navigating to Node, running npm start and then npm start from terminal.

If you have a leap motion controller, you can plug it in and change the temperatures of the various Nest thermostats by making circular gestures on the themrostats.
A swipe will change between floors.
A key tap will send an API call out to actually change the temperatures in the Nest thermometers.

The thermometers/floors are hard-coded, this was just a MVP I will continue to work on.
